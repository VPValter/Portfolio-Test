# Portfolio-Test

*My very first front end project*

* This is a relatively basic single-page portfolio website made largely using **Bootstrap 4**.
* It is fully responsive and features a **CSS** media query, scrollspy, flex view, CSS animation, etc.
* It uses a **jQuery** .animate() script for smooth-scrolling navigation.

## Future plans:
- [ ] Updating with more advanced features
