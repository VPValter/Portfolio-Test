# Portfolio-Test

_My very first front end project_

- This is a relatively basic single-page portfolio website made largely using **Bootstrap 4**.
- It is fully responsive and features a **CSS** media query, scrollspy, flex view, CSS animation, etc.
- It uses a **jQuery** .animate() script for smooth-scrolling navigation.

### Future plans:

~~ [ ] Updating with more advanced features ~~

## NOTE:

**I have a newer version of a single-page responsive website that's done with no Bootstrap or any frameworks [here](https://github.com/VPValter/Burger-House)**
